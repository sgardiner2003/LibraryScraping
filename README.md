Sometimes when I'm on Libby browsing for audiobooks, I see books 30 hours long that I know don't take that long to read, and others that are long page-wise but their listening time is only a few hours. The only explanation is that some audiobook narrators are slower than others. This project's goal is to figure out if some audiobook narrators are slower than others, and if so, who they are!

Everything is done in Python, and eventually I plan to move the data into Excel or SQL to do some analysis and make visualizations.
